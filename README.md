In general orders are created from carts by front end. For redirect payments like Credit card 3D Secure, Paypal or Sofort√ºberweisung front end is confronted with an issue that in some cases there is a valid payment but no order as user did not reach front end's success URL, which creates an order from current cart. One of the use cases would be lost internet connection or accidentally closed tab after successfully issued payment. Scheduled processor ensures that for every successful payment and valid cart an order is created.
